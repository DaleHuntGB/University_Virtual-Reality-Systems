# Project Idea
+ Update [Attendy](https://attendy.co.uk/) to accommodate augmented reality to help students navigate the university buildings more freely.

# TODO
+ Rebuild Attendy in NextJS for an improved user-experience.
+ Create screenshots that present the current state that Attendy is in, this is required to ensure that marking is focused on the addition of mixed reality.

# Implementation Ideas
+ Scan QR Code or use phone camera to identify the students current location within the university.
+ Students can be prompted on what room they are looking for.
+ Augmented Reality can display their live location and direct them through the university with arrows.
